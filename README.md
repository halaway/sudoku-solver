# Sudoku Solver
Applying Data Structures, SDL Graphics and Multi-Threading

## Dependencies
- Windows 10 / Mac
- c++11

## Description 

Firstly, this project uses a Backtracking algorithm to find the solution of a given Sudoku Board in the form of a 2D vector. 
The project also supports concurrency through the implementation of multithreading and asynchronous operations to handle various independent CPU-intensive sub-tasks, allowing multiple processes to make progress. 

A board can be of any size NxN, however, boards _4x4_, _6x6_, _9x9_, and _16x16_ lead to possible solutions where sub-grids are taken 
into account to ensure no number is repeated, coinciding with the rules of Sudoku. All other grid sizes do not account for 
repeating values within sub-grids. If a solution is found, the vector is updated with the possible solutions. 

Secondly, the project goes further and creates a window displaying a board of size _9x9_ with the hints of a given Sudoku board. 
It allows for a text file with values to be converted into a 2D vector. Once displayed, the user can select a given grid location 
and input a value between _1-9_ or _"spacebar"_ or _"."_ to remove the current value. To solve, the user presses _"enter"_. It's important to note that a board can have more than one solution depending on the number of hints given and their position on the board with a 
minimum of 17 positions needed to find a solution. 

## Features

## Note
There aren't sufficient error cases for using grids of larger or smaller sizes. Also, the window is of a certain width and height, 
but, future improvements can be made to account for changes in window size as well as for changes in the Board size greater than or less than _9_.
The "OpenSans-Regular.ttf" or any suitable font will also have to be downloaded to use.
